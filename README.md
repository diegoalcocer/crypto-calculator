# Crypto Calculator

---

## Summary

The Crypto-Calculator is a command-line interface (CLI) utility which allows you to perform the following functions:

1. Retrieve Current Crypto Exchange Rates
2. Create Crypto Cumulative Daily Return Reports 
3. Control User Crypto Accounts and Wallets
   - Create New User Accounts
   - Add Funds to USD Wallet
   - Buy and Sell Cryptocurrencies
   - Retrieve User Wallet Balances

Additionally, there is a supplemental Jupyter Notebook which visually demonstrates historical changes in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP).  Historical data is collected from [Bitstamp](https://www.bitstamp.net) and analyzed within Pandas DataFrames.

User and Wallet data is stored locally within an SQLite3 database.  User passwords are bcrypt salted and hashed.

Cryptocurrency exchange rates are performed in real-time via [Alternative.me's Crypto API](https://alternative.me/crypto/api/)
